title: Code of conduct

## For HasGeek events

We are here as a community to deliberate on the topics of the event.

1. Be nice to everyone,
2. Be empathetic,
3. Be questioning, as it furthers the discussion, but
4. Discuss ideas, not people and their personalities (as that would be ad hominem).

We strongly condemn any kind of harassment of any fellow participant. This includes:

1. Sustained disruption of talks and other events.
2. Offensive remarks or jokes made about women, men, persons of non-binary genders and those with physical disabilities, or on the basis of sexuality, race, caste or religion.
3. Use of images that objectify the human body unless absolutely relevant to the discussion.
4. Inappropriate physical contact and invasion of private space.
5. Deliberate intimidation, unwelcome gestures and stalking.
6. Photography or audio/video recording of individuals without explicit consent.

Please report in confidence by sending an SMS to +91 7676 33 2020. SMSes are received by HasGeek staff who can address this quickly.

Violators, regardless of their standing, may be expelled without a refund and reported to the authorities.
