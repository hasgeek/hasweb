Welcome to our website. If you continue to browse and use this website you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions of use, which together with our privacy policy govern HasGeek Media LLP’s relationship with you in relation to our website, events, services and products except to the extent they are overriden by special terms that we announce with respect to the respective service, website, event or product.

The term “HasGeek Media LLP” or “us” or “we” refers to the owner of the website whose registered office is No 141/142, 2nd Cross, Pai Layout, Hulimavu Gate, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore - 560 076, Karnataka, India. Our registration number is AAA-3107 and we are incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008 of India. 

We take great care to produce outstanding code, render services and/or products. But there is a great chance the code will have bugs, products will not work exactly as you expect and there is the small chance you may be unhappy with our services. In any event, that cannot be grounds to sue us in a court of law. In legal speak, this service is provided on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis. No warranties, no liability. Except of course, if the law otherwise provides.

HASGEEK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF HASGEEK HAS BEEN INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

We charge for certain services and provide other services without charge. But whether we do charge or not is a commercial decision and we believe it is important that we reserve the right to change pricing and relating policies if we feel the need to do so. But we will alert you when we are about to bring to effect such changes.

If an API is likely to expose information contributed by you, we will take your consent before enabling it.

## Fulfilment

For specific products and services, we provide product fulfilment terms that determine when a product or service is deemed to be delivered.

* Job Board

Every paid job board listing is valid for a pre-specified period eg. 30 days. Fulfilment of a job board listing order occurs on such listing being published and remaining available on our Job Board site for a the specific period. Pricing for various categories of listings will be publicly available depending on the availability of such a service and available inventory.

The terms of service specific to posting a listing are listed under the [Job Boards Terms of Service](jbtos).

* Events

HasGeek organizes events e.g. conferences, workshops, hacknights for the technology community, and incurs expenses for venue, food, snacks, stationery & printing, audio & video equipment as well as other rental or purchased equipment. HasGeek reserves entry to select events only to valid ticket holders. A ticket is valid only for the persons named on the ticket issued by us.

Pricing for each event will be publicly available for specified period before the event. Apart from making tickets available online, HasGeek may also hold a portion of the venue capacity for onsite ticket purchases. Tickets will be available for purchase until there is capacity at the venue, as defined by its safety guidelines or as set by HasGeek - whichever is lower.

Fulfilment for an event happens on the conclusion of the event associated with a validly purchased/issued ticket. That means that ‘technically’ the service has been provided once the event ends, even though we may provide you with additional materials after the event.

* Advertising

HasGeek makes physical and online space available for advertisers to showcase their products, APIs and services, for a fee. Specific terms for such opportunities will apply and will be set forth separately (in an email, ordering facility, written agreement, etc). The advertising order will be considered fulfilled once the Advertiser’s collateral has been displayed or serviced for a pre-specified period of time. 

The terms of service specific to submitting an advertising or sponsorship request are listed under the [Advertising Terms of Service](adtos).

## Refunds and Cancellations.

* Job Board
HasGeek reserves the right to consider refunding the purchase amount for such a listing. By issuing a submission to the job board, you acknowledge full awareness of that your purchase amount may not be refunded.

* Events
You cannot cancel your ticket for an event if you have purchased that ticket using our online payment option. We may cancel an event due to unforeseen reasons or circumstances outside our control (Force Majeure events such as floods, fire, riots, terrorist incidents, bandhs, etc). If that happens, refund of your purchase amount will be under HasGeek's discretion. 

* Advertising
Advertisers may cancel their order through Customer's account if online cancellation functionality is available, or, if not available, with prior written notice to HasGeek, including without limitation electronic mail.  The cancellation of any advertising may be subject to HasGeek’s Advertising Program policies or HasGeek’s ability to re-schedule reserved inventory or cancel ads already in production. Cancelled ads may be published despite cancellation if cancellation of those ads occurs after any applicable commitment date as set forth in advance by HasGeek, in which case Advertiser must pay for those ads.

## Payment

Hasgeek may provide more than one payment method as a convenience to you. This may include online payment gateways operated by other companies. The operation of these payment transactions occurs outside our control and we only receive a confirmation of payment from payment gateway provider.  There are a number of reasons why your payment transaction may fail and we may not be able to provide a suitable explanation for that failure. We are incorporated as an Indian entity and accept payments only in Indian currency. 

## Breach

If you violate these terms, HasGeek may discontinue providing you one or more or all services/products and/or refuse to provide you with access to the HasGeek Websites. In addition,, we still reserve the right to recover any amounts due and owing by you to HasGeek and to take strict legal action including but not limited to a referral to the appropriate police or other authorities for initiating criminal or other proceedings against you.

In short, WE CAN EXCOMMUNICATE YOU. HAUL YOUR ASS TO COURT. TAKE YOU TO THE COPS.

## Indemnity

You shall indemnify and hold harmless HasGeek, its owners (and partners as applicable), licensee, affiliates, subsidiaries, group companies (as applicable) and their respective officers, directors, agents, and employees, from any claim or demand, or actions including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party or penalty imposed due to or arising out of your breach of this Terms of Use, privacy Policy and other Policies, or your violation of any law, rules or regulations or the rights of a third party.
