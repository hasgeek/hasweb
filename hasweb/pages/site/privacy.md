## How we use cookies

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree (your browser may be configured to automatically agree on your behalf), the file is added. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

We use cookies to log traffic on our website, that is, to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse and improve our website in order to tailor it to fit our customers' needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website as several aspects of it require cookies to function normally.

## Third party services we use

We use analytics tools and other third party technologies, such as Google Analytics, to collect non-personal information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use our services.

The third party analytics companies who collect information on our services and other online products and/or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. You may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page or by using an ad blocker.
