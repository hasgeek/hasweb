title: Terms of Service

Welcome to our website. If you continue to browse and use this website you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions of use, which together with our privacy policy govern HasGeek Media LLP’s relationship with you in relation to our website, events, services and products except to the extent they are overriden by special terms that we announce with respect to the respective service, website, event or product.

The term “HasGeek Media LLP” or “us” or “we” refers to the owner of the website whose registered office is No 141/142, 2nd Cross, Pai Layout, Hulimavu Gate, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore - 560 076, Karnataka, India. Our registration number is AAA-3107 and we are incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008 of India. 

## Website, services and third party dealings 

Scenario 1: We take great care to produce outstanding code, render services and/or products. But there is a great chance the code will have bugs, products will not work exactly as you expect and there is the small chance you may be unhappy with our services. 

Scenario 2: Through your use of our websites, attendance at our events or use of our services, with or without our intervention or facilitation, you may engage with other individuals or companies, including, for instance, advertisers or prospective employers. Your dealings with them are your business entirely. 

Scenario 3: HasGeek makes available information interfaces that expose content and functionality from HasGeek’s websites, to third party developers. If an interface is likely to expose information contributed by you, we will take your consent before enabling it. We will have rules governing the use of the API by such developers/companies/third party websites, but we cannot be held responsible for their use of the interface in a manner that is inappropriate or violates an applicable law.

None of the above scenarios can be grounds to sue us in a court of law. In legal speak, this service is provided on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis. No warranties, no liability. Except of course, if the law otherwise provides.

HASGEEK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF HASGEEK HAS BEEN INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

* I understand that listings are valid for 30 days only, or
* I understand the listing will be removed if:
	* It is a position that involves adult content, or
	* It is a illegal work opportunity, or
	* Job information is factually incorrect, misleading, incomplete and or or inaccurate of what is being offered or advertised, or
