## Third Party Dealings

From time to time this website may also include links to other websites. These links are provided for the User's convenience to provide further information. They do not signify that we endorse the website(s). We have no responsibility for the content of the linked website(s).

## Payment and pricing

We charge for certain services and provide other services without charge. But whether we do charge or not is a commercial decision and we believe it is important that we reserve the right to change pricing and relating policies if we feel the need to do so. We will alert the User when we are about to effect such changes.

Hasgeek may provide more than one payment method as a convenience to the User. This may include online payment gateways operated by other companies. The operation of these payment transactions occurs outside our control and we only receive a confirmation of payment from payment gateway provider. There are a number of reasons why the User's payment transaction may fail and we may not be able to provide a suitable explanation for that failure. We are incorporated as an Indian entity and accept payments only in Indian currency. 

## Fulfilment

For specific products and services, we provide product fulfilment terms that determine when a product or service is deemed to be delivered.

__Job Board__

The terms of service specific to posting a listing are listed under the [Job Boards Terms of Service](jbtos).

__Events__

HasGeek organizes events e.g. conferences, workshops, hacknights for the technology community, and incurs expenses for venue, food, snacks, stationery & printing, audio & video equipment as well as other rental or purchased equipment. HasGeek reserves entry to select events only to valid ticket holders. A ticket is valid only for the persons named on the ticket issued by us.

Pricing for each event will be publicly available for specified period before the event. Apart from making tickets available online, HasGeek may also hold a portion of the venue capacity for onsite ticket purchases. Tickets will be available for purchase until there is capacity at the venue, as defined by its safety guidelines or as set by HasGeek - whichever is lower.

Fulfilment for an event happens on the conclusion of the event associated with a validly purchased/issued ticket. That means that ‘technically’ the service has been provided once the event ends, even though we may provide the User with additional materials after the event.

__Advertising__

The terms of service specific to submitting an advertising or sponsorship request are listed under the [Advertising Terms of Service](adtos).

## Refunds
For our refund policy regarding cancellation and returns, please refer to our [Refunds policy](refunds).
