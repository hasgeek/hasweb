Through your use of our websites, attendance at our events or use of our services, with or without our intervention or facilitation, you may engage with other individuals or companies, including, for instance, advertisers or prospective employers.

We maintain basic standards for preserving the confidentiality of your information on the website commensurate with the kind of services we provide, but please be aware that our website and your information may be vulnerable to attack by determined hackers.

We will have rules governing the use of the API by such developers/companies/third party websites, but we cannot be held responsible for their use of the API in a manner that is inappropriate or violates an applicable law.

## Fulfilment

For specific products and services, we provide product fulfilment terms that determine when a product or service is deemed to be delivered.

* Job Board

The terms of service specific to posting a listing are listed under the [Job Boards Terms of Service](jbtos).

* Events

HasGeek organizes events e.g. conferences, workshops, hacknights for the technology community, and incurs expenses for venue, food, snacks, stationery & printing, audio & video equipment as well as other rental or purchased equipment. HasGeek reserves entry to select events only to valid ticket holders. A ticket is valid only for the persons named on the ticket issued by us.

Pricing for each event will be publicly available for specified period before the event. Apart from making tickets available online, HasGeek may also hold a portion of the venue capacity for onsite ticket purchases. Tickets will be available for purchase until there is capacity at the venue, as defined by its safety guidelines or as set by HasGeek - whichever is lower.

Fulfilment for an event happens on the conclusion of the event associated with a validly purchased/issued ticket. That means that ‘technically’ the service has been provided once the event ends, even though we may provide you with additional materials after the event.

* Advertising

The terms of service specific to submitting an advertising or sponsorship request are listed under the [Advertising Terms of Service](adtos).

## Refunds and Cancellations.

The terms of service specific to the job board are listed under [job board Terms of Service](hjtos)

* Events
You cannot cancel your ticket for an event if you have purchased that ticket using our online payment option. We may cancel an event due to unforeseen reasons or circumstances outside our control (Force Majeure events such as floods, fire, riots, terrorist incidents, bandhs, etc). If that happens, refund of your purchase amount will be under HasGeek's discretion. 

* Sponsorship and advertising
The terms of service specific to sponsorship and advertisment are listed under [sponsorship and advertisement Terms of Service](adtos)

## Payment

Hasgeek may provide more than one payment method as a convenience to you. This may include online payment gateways operated by other companies. The operation of these payment transactions occurs outside our control and we only receive a confirmation of payment from payment gateway provider. There are a number of reasons why your payment transaction may fail and we may not be able to provide a suitable explanation for that failure. We are incorporated as an Indian entity and accept payments only in Indian currency. 

## Breach

If you violate these terms, HasGeek may discontinue providing you with one or more or all services/products and/or refuse to provide you with access to the HasGeek Websites. In addition, we still reserve the right to recover any amounts due and owed by you to HasGeek and to take strict legal action including but not limited to a referral to the appropriate legal instituition or other authorities for initiating criminal or other proceedings against you.

## Indemnity

You shall indemnify and hold harmless HasGeek, its owners (and partners as applicable), licensee, affiliates, subsidiaries, group companies (as applicable) and their respective officers, directors, agents, and employees, from any claim or demand, or actions including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party or penalty imposed due to or arising out of your breach of this Terms of Use, privacy Policy and other Policies, or your violation of any law, rules or regulations or the rights of a third party.

## Governing Law

Again. We are incorporated in India. All dealings with you are governed by, interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of India. If we have a dispute and any party wishes to initiate legal proceedings in a court of law, the courts at Bangalore shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

Your use under these terms must not violate applicable laws, must comply with our content guidelines (which we may vary from time to time) and is subject to deletion or suspension if we receive complaints from third parties.
